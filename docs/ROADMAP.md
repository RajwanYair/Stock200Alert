# CrossTide — Development Roadmap

## Vision
CrossTide is a cross-platform stock monitoring toolkit that detects **moving-average crossover events** (SMA50 / SMA150 / SMA200), benchmarks ticker performance against the S&P 500, and empowers individual investors with actionable, real-time alerts — all without paid API keys.

> Ideas in this roadmap were consolidated from 12+ production projects in the workspace  
> (ExplorerLens, RegiLattice, DupDetector, FileProcessor, OptimizeBrowsers, PPA, VHDXCompress,  
> VSCode.RemoteSSH.Verifier, and others) plus standard enterprise engineering patterns.
