# CrossTide — Strategic Roadmap (Deep Rethink, May 2026)

> **Last updated:** May 1, 2026
> **Declared version:** v6.4.0 (Sprints 1–130 shipped)
> **Codebase scale:** 215 source modules, 1772 unit tests, ~98% domain coverage,
> 359 commits, 11 release candidates.
> **Honest verdict:** We have built a **best-in-class utility/domain library**.
> We have **not yet** built a best-in-class **product**. This roadmap closes that gap.

This document supersedes the prior roadmap (`ROADMAP.archive-2026-04.md`). It is the
result of a **second** end-to-end rethink — every decision, including the ones that
looked clean six months ago, is re-examined against where the project actually is in
May 2026. The conclusion drove a re-prioritization, not a re-architecture: the
foundations are sound; what's missing is **integration, deployment, and
product-grade UX**.

## 1. Executive Summary

**Where we are.** Eleven release candidates and 130 sprints in, CrossTide has the
deepest pure-TypeScript indicator/utility library in its peer set: 30+ technical
indicators with exhaustive tests, a complete consensus engine, alert state
machine, backtest engine with risk metrics, portfolio analytics, IndexedDB-backed
tiered cache, sync queue, token-bucket limiter, CSP/SRI builders, signals store,
worker RPC, fuzzy match, ARIA live announcer, and dozens more — all strict-typed,
tree-shakable, and tested.

**The honest gap.** None of that is yet a _product a user can open and love_.
`main.ts` wires watchlist + theme only. Charts render an OHLC table. The
Cloudflare Worker exists but isn't deployed. The PWA shell is minimal. There is
no E2E test, no Lighthouse CI run, no real charting library on the page.

**The pivot.** Stop adding library modules at v6.1's pace. Spend v6.2 on
**Integration & Activation**: deploy the Worker, swap to History API routing,
adopt signals-based state, lazy-mount every existing card via the registry, ship
Lightweight Charts, and turn on Workbox + Playwright + Lighthouse CI. v6.3 polishes
real-time, portfolio, and screener. v7.0 brings optional Passkey-encrypted cloud
sync. v8.0 (stretch) opens streaming/social features.

**One sentence.** _We've built the engine; v6.2 builds the car around it._

## 2. State of the Project — Honest Audit, Round 2

### 2.1 What is genuinely done (May 2026)

| Area                                                                                                                                                         | Status                   | Evidence                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain library** — 30+ indicators, consensus, alerts, backtest                                                                                             | ✅ Excellent             | `src/domain/*` (~75 files), 98%+ coverage                |
| **Core utilities** — signals, IDB, tiered cache, fetch, retry, circuit-breaker, RPC, sync-queue, token-bucket, CSP/SRI builders, hash/uuid/seedrandom/easing | ✅ Excellent             | `src/core/*` (~70 files)                                 |
| **UI utilities** — toast, modal, sortable, sparkline, command palette, fuzzy-match, focus-trap, container-query, ARIA live                                   | ✅ Built, mostly unwired | `src/ui/*` (~35 files)                                   |
| **Card scaffolds** — 15+ feature cards                                                                                                                       | ⚠️ Skeletons             | render summaries, not interactive                        |
| **TypeScript strictness**                                                                                                                                    | ✅ Maximum               | `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` |
| **Toolchain** — TS 5.9, Vite 8, Vitest 4.1, ESLint 10, Stylelint, htmlhint, markdownlint                                                                     | ✅ Modern                | shared with `MyScripts/tooling`                          |
| **CI gates** — typecheck, lint:all, test:coverage, build, bundle-size                                                                                        | ✅ Green                 | `npm run ci` passes; 1772 tests                          |
| **Worker source** — Yahoo / Twelve / CoinGecko / Polygon proxy                                                                                               | ✅ Authored              | `worker/src/*`                                           |
| **PWA scaffold** — manifest + `sw.ts` (precache + SWR)                                                                                                       | ✅ Minimal               | not Workbox                                              |
| **Documentation** — README, CHANGELOG, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, COPILOT_GUIDE, this roadmap                                                               | ✅ Honest                | but no per-indicator reference                           |

### 2.2 What is missing or weak (the gap)

- **Integration debt #1: `main.ts` is still 30 lines.** The card registry isn't
  wired; only watchlist + theme + add/remove are live. Every other card sits in
  `src/cards/` exporting `mount()` functions nobody calls.
- **No real charting.** `cards/chart.ts` renders an OHLC table.
  `lightweight-charts` is not in `package.json`.
- **Hash router still in use** (`src/ui/router.ts`). Defers History API,
  blocks deep links and OG images.
- **State plumbing is split.** `core/state.ts` (EventTarget) and `core/signals.ts`
  (signal/computed/effect) coexist. Cards use neither consistently. Pick one.
- **Worker not deployed.** No `wrangler.toml` env, no DNS, no production secret
  store. Browser still hits mock fixtures in tests.
- **No live-data path.** Polling code exists; nobody calls it from the UI.
- **No E2E tests.** `tests/` has `unit/` only.
- **No accessibility tests.** `axe-core` not in deps; ARIA helpers exist but
  aren't asserted.
- **No Lighthouse CI.** Bundle-size gate exists, performance budget not enforced.
- **No error tracking, no analytics.** Code paths exist (`analytics.ts`,
  `error-boundary.ts`) but no sink.
- **No streaming.** Polling-only, even though Finnhub WS is in the design.
- **No auth, no cloud sync.** Acceptable for v6.x; blocks multi-device users at v7.
- **No Web Worker offload of compute** despite `compute-worker.ts` and
  `worker-rpc.ts` existing — backtests still run on the main thread when invoked.
- **Hash-only IDB schema versioning is informal.** `idb-migrations.ts` exists but
  isn't exercised by every store.
- **Library modules vastly outnumber product modules.** ~140 library files vs
  ~15 product (card) files. The ratio is upside-down for a product.
- **Per-indicator documentation is absent.** 30 indicators, ~0 reference pages.
- **No design system catalog.** Tokens exist; nobody can browse the components.

### 2.3 What changed since the April rethink

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8 more release candidates shipped (rc.4 → rc.11)                                                                                              | +60 modules, +900 tests                                   |
| Toolchain stayed pinned to TS 5.9 / Vite 8 / Vitest 4.1                                                                                       | No drift, low risk                                        |
| Library coverage now spans hashing, RNG, easing, base64, timezone, clipboard, ARIA-live, etc.                                                 | Foundation **over-saturated** for current product surface |
| Worker code unchanged                                                                                                                         | Deploy still pending                                      |
| `main.ts` unchanged                                                                                                                           | Wiring still pending                                      |
| Cards `screener`, `portfolio`, `consensus`, `alerts`, `settings`, `heatmap`, `provider-health`, `performance-metrics` etc. exist as scaffolds | Need activation, not creation                             |

**Conclusion of round 2:** the _strategy_ in the April roadmap was right. The
_execution priority_ has drifted — we kept building library, not product. This
roadmap re-anchors the next 12 months on **product activation**.

## 3. Decision Rethink Matrix v2

Every prior decision is re-examined for May 2026. Verdict = `Keep` / `Refine` /
`Replace` / `Defer`. Bold rows changed since April.

### What this comparison tells us

**Where we already win or will win in v6.3:**

- Open source + self-hostable + privacy (nobody else combines all three)
- Consensus engine (genuinely unique product feature)
- Bundle size & Lighthouse (10–25× smaller than incumbents)
- Offline + Workbox + Background Sync (only GhostFolio competes)
- Keyboard + a11y (only TradingView and Koyfin try)

**Where we must close gaps to be best-in-class:**

## 7. Frontend Strategy

### 7.1 Rendering model

- **Default:** Vanilla TS + `@preact/signals-core`. Cards declare a `mount(host, signals)` and a `dispose()`. `effect()` reactively binds DOM.
- **Promote to Lit only when justified:** chart toolbar, screener filter chip group, command palette. Each promotion needs a one-page rationale in the PR.
- **No JSX runtime in the bundle.** Lit uses tagged templates; vanilla cards use `el.textContent = …` with `escapeHtml` enforcement.

### 7.2 Routing

- History API. Routes (final list):

```text
/                            → dashboard (default cards)
/watchlist                   → watchlist card focused
/chart/:symbol               → chart + panels
/screener                    → screener card
/portfolio                   → portfolio card
/backtest/:symbol            → backtest UI
/alerts                      → alerts card + history
/settings                    → settings card
/about                       → static about
```

- Cloudflare Pages SPA fallback handles refresh on any path. GH Pages mirror gets `404.html` redirect trick.
- Per-route lazy `import()` of card module; preload on hover/focus.

### 7.3 State

- `signal<T>(initial)` is the only state primitive.
- `persistedSignal('key', initial, { storage: 'idb' | 'local' })` for durable state.
- `BroadcastChannel` for cross-tab sync (`broadcast-channel.ts` to be added in A4 — small).
- No global mutable singletons except the registry of signals.

### 7.4 Charting

- `lightweight-charts@^5` dynamic import only on `/chart/*` route.
- Sub-panes for RSI, MACD, Stochastic, ADX, Klinger, Choppiness. All wired to existing domain calculators.
- Signal markers driven by `consensus-engine`.
- Saved chart state (overlays, range) persisted per symbol in IDB.

### 7.5 Accessibility

- Skip-link, landmark roles, `:focus-visible` rings.
- All interactive cards keyboard-reachable; `role="application"` on charts only.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-contrast`, forced-colors mode honored.
- WCAG 2.2 AA gated by axe in CI.
- Live announcer (`announceLive`) used on add/remove/error.

### 7.6 Theming

- `data-theme="dark|light|auto"` + system preference.
- High-contrast, deuteranopia, protanopia palettes (Phase C).
- `view-transition-name` on route container for smooth switches.

### 7.7 Internationalization (Phase C)

- `@formatjs/intl` + ICU.
- `dir="rtl"` for Hebrew; tokens already direction-agnostic.
- Date/number formatting via `Intl.*` (already in `core/date-format.ts`, `ui/date-format.ts`, `ui/number-format.ts`, `core/timezone.ts`).

## 8. Backend, Data & Infrastructure Strategy

### 8.1 API surface (Cloudflare Pages Functions)

| Route                                       | Method  | Purpose                      | Cache                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/api/health`                               | GET     | Status + provider health     | none                    |
| `/api/quote/:symbol`                        | GET     | Spot quote                   | KV 60s open / 5m closed |
| `/api/history/:symbol?range=1y&interval=1d` | GET     | Daily OHLCV                  | KV 24h, R2 cold         |
| `/api/search?q=`                            | GET     | Symbol autocomplete          | KV 1h                   |
| `/api/og/:symbol.png`                       | GET     | OG image (mini chart)        | edge 1h                 |
| `/api/stream`                               | WSS     | Live quotes (Durable Object) | n/a                     |
| `/api/errors`                               | POST    | Sampled error ingestion      | none                    |
| `/api/sync`                                 | GET/PUT | Encrypted user blob (v7)     | n/a                     |

### 8.2 Provider chain

```text
quote:    Yahoo → Finnhub → Alpha Vantage   (circuit breaker per provider)
history:  Yahoo → Stooq → Finnhub → Polygon
search:   Yahoo → Finnhub
crypto:   CoinGecko (only)
stream:   Finnhub WSS → Polygon WSS         (auth headers in Worker only)
```

### 8.3 Circuit breaker

- States: `closed` (normal), `open` (skip provider 60 s), `half-open` (one probe).
- Per-provider counters in Worker memory + KV (mirrored).
- Surfaced via `/api/health` and Provider Health card.
- Already implemented in `core/circuit-breaker.ts`; needs wiring at the chain boundary.

### 8.4 Secrets

- All API keys are **Worker env vars only**. No keys in browser, no keys in repo.
- `wrangler secret put` for production; `.dev.vars` (gitignored) for local.
- Repo-level guard: pre-commit hook runs `git diff --staged | rg -q '(api[_-]?key|token).*=.*[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}'` and aborts on hit.

### 8.5 Rate limits & abuse

- Per-IP token bucket (`core/token-bucket.ts` already implemented; wire KV-backed variant in Worker) at 60 req/min per route.
- Reject requests without a known `Origin` in production.
- Daily budget alarm via Cloudflare Analytics.

### 8.6 Infrastructure summary

| Layer          | Tech                                 | Why                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Static hosting | Cloudflare Pages                     | Free, SPA fallback, preview deploys, edge POPs |
| Edge runtime   | Cloudflare Workers (Pages Functions) | Same vendor, same deploy, V8 isolates          |
| Cold storage   | Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)        | $0 egress, free tier 10 GB                     |
| Hot KV         | Cloudflare KV                        | Free tier 100K ops/day                         |
| Streaming      | Cloudflare Durable Objects (WS)      | Per-symbol consistent fan-out                  |
| DNS / TLS      | Cloudflare (free tier)               | Same vendor                                    |
| Mirror         | GitHub Pages                         | Redundancy if Cloudflare degrades              |
| CI             | GitHub Actions                       | Free for public repos                          |
| Error tracking | Self-hosted GlitchTip on Fly.io      | $0/mo personal hobby tier                      |
| Analytics      | Self-hosted Plausible on Fly.io      | $0/mo personal tier                            |
| Status page    | Self-hosted Uptime Kuma              | $0/mo personal tier                            |

**Total infrastructure cost target: $0/mo for personal use.** First paid line if/when Polygon API key is needed (~$29/mo).

## 9. Storage, Sync & Offline Strategy

### 9.1 Tiers (refined)

| Tier        | Tech                                          | Use                                   | TTL / Cap         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| L1          | `Map` (`core/cache.ts`)                       | Hot quotes, computed series           | session           |
| L2          | `localStorage`                                | Config, theme, last route             | persistent, ~5 MB |
| L3          | IndexedDB (`core/idb.ts` + `tiered-cache.ts`) | Candles, alerts, portfolio, snapshots | LRU 50 MB         |
| L4          | Service Worker Cache API                      | App shell + API responses (SWR)       | per-strategy      |
| Edge        | Cloudflare KV / R2                            | Hot quotes / cold history             | TTL / cold        |
| Cloud (opt) | Worker + KV (v7)                              | Per-passkey-user encrypted blobs      | per-user          |

### 9.2 Storage pressure

- `navigator.storage.estimate()` polled hourly (`storage-pressure.ts` already exists — wire it).
- Warn at 80%, evict L3 LRU, offer one-tap clear.
- `navigator.storage.persist()` requested after first opt-in action.

### 9.3 Schema versioning

- IDB version migrations declared in `core/idb-migrations.ts`. Every store has a numbered version.
- Config schema validated by Valibot; migrations declared per version bump.
- Export envelope: `{ schema: 'crosstide.export', version: 3, exportedAt, payload }`. Import refuses unknown versions older than current minus 2.

### 9.4 Cloud sync (v7.0, optional)

- Passkeys → opaque user id → Worker stores **encrypted** blob in KV.
- Client-side encryption with key derived from a user-chosen pass-phrase (Argon2id via WASM, or HKDF over WebAuthn challenge response).
- Server never sees plaintext watchlist/portfolio.
- Conflict strategy: last-writer-wins per top-level key, with vector clock for portfolio (CRDT-ish but not a full CRDT — too heavy for v7).

## 10. Quality, Security & Observability

### 10.1 CI gates (every required for merge)

```text
typecheck            tsc --noEmit (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
lint                 eslint . --max-warnings 0
lint:css             stylelint
lint:html            htmlhint
lint:md              markdownlint-cli2
test                 vitest run --coverage  (≥90% statements, ≥80% branches)
test:e2e             playwright (10 flows)
a11y                 axe in E2E (0 serious/critical)
build                vite build
bundle               check-bundle-size.mjs (<180 KB gz initial)
lighthouse           lhci autorun (perf ≥90, a11y ≥95, best ≥95, SEO ≥90)
audit                npm audit --omit=dev (no high/critical) + audit-signatures
audit:supply         socket.dev PR check
secret-scan          gitleaks
```

### 10.2 Security

- **CSP** via Worker headers, built by existing `core/csp-builder.ts`:
  `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self' https://api.crosstide.dev wss://api.crosstide.dev; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- **SRI** on every third-party asset (target: zero third-party assets).
- **Permissions-Policy:** `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()`.
- **Subresource hashes** verified in CI (`core/sri.ts` already built).
- **Valibot validation** on every external input (provider responses, URL params, imported JSON).
- **`escapeHtml` enforced** via custom ESLint rule — no `innerHTML` without it.
- **Dependabot weekly** + manual review for major bumps.
- **`gitleaks`** in pre-commit and CI.

### 10.3 Observability

- **Errors:** GlitchTip (self-hosted, Sentry-compatible), 25% sampled, scrubbed, no PII.
- **Analytics:** Plausible (cookieless). Route changes, card mounts, uncaught error counts.
- **RUM:** `core/web-vitals.ts` reported to Plausible custom events.
- **Server-side:** Cloudflare Analytics + structured `console.log` → Logpush → R2.
- **Status page:** Uptime Kuma probing `/api/health` every minute.

## 13. Developer Experience

| Area            | Decision                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package manager | npm (shared `MyScripts/node_modules`) — keep                           |
| Workspaces      | Convert to npm workspaces: `app/`, `worker/`, `docs-site/`             |
| Git hooks       | `simple-git-hooks` + `lint-staged` (no Husky bloat)                    |
| Commit style    | Conventional Commits, enforced by `commitlint` (start v6.2)            |
| Releases        | **Changesets** auto-generated CHANGELOG + version bump PR (start v6.2) |
| PR previews     | Cloudflare Pages auto preview per branch                               |
| Local Worker    | `wrangler dev` proxied through Vite (`server.proxy`)                   |
| Mock data       | `tests/fixtures/` realistic OHLC fixtures                              |
| Component dev   | `dev/components.html` mounting every card with mock signals            |
| Editor          | `.vscode/settings.json` shared in repo                                 |
| Docs preview    | `npm -w docs-site run dev`                                             |

**Sprint cadence (continued from rc.11):**

- Per-sprint commit. Per-RC tag + GitHub prerelease.
- One sprint = one cohesive change with passing CI.
- 10 sprints per RC was sustainable; **drop to 5 sprints per RC for v6.2** because each sprint is now a _product activation_ (heavier, riskier) rather than a _library module_ (light, isolated).

| Fly.io (GlitchTip + Plausible host)     | Low                 | Both Dockerized; portable to any container host.                                                                                    |

## 15. Phased Roadmap

### Phase A — v6.2 _Activation_ (the central pivot)

**Theme:** wire the library into a product. Stop adding library modules until every existing card mounts, charts work, the Worker is deployed, and CI runs Lighthouse + Playwright.

**Sprint cadence:** 5 sprints per RC. Each RC ends with a green Lighthouse run.

**Exit criteria for v6.2:**

- Every card in `src/cards/` mounts via the registry.
- Charts render with Lightweight Charts and signal markers.
- Worker is deployed; provider chain works end-to-end against real APIs.
- 10 Playwright flows pass; axe finds zero serious/critical issues.
- Lighthouse: perf ≥ 90, a11y ≥ 95, best ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 90.
- Bundle ≤ 180 KB gz initial.

#### B12 — Instrument-type views (Stocks / ETFs / Crypto)

Auto-classify each watchlist entry using the `quoteType` field returned by Yahoo Finance
(`EQUITY` → Stock, `ETF` → ETF, `CRYPTOCURRENCY` → Crypto, unknown → Other).
Add a filter-chip bar above the watchlist table (`All / Stocks / ETFs / Crypto`) that
instantly filters rows without re-fetching. Store the user's last-selected tab in
`localStorage`. Manual override: right-click (or long-press) a ticker to force-assign a
type. Extend `WatchlistEntry` in the config schema and persist overrides in IDB.
Type badges appear in the ticker cell (a small coloured chip).

#### B13 — Sector grouping in the watchlist

Resolve GICS sector for each equity from Yahoo Finance `sector` field in the chart
`meta` object. Group watchlist rows under collapsible `<tr class="sector-header">` rows
per sector (Technology, Healthcare, Financials, …). Each sector header shows: sector
name, row count, and an aggregated mini-consensus badge (% BUY across holdings in that
sector). Sector headers sort alphabetically; tickers within a sector respect the current
sort column. Collapsed/expanded state is persisted per sector in `localStorage`. ETFs
and Crypto fall into `— ETFs —` / `— Crypto —` group rows at the bottom.

#### B14 — Universal sortable column headers

Every `<table>` in the app (watchlist, screener, portfolio holdings, backtest results,
alert history) must have fully interactive `<th>` headers with:

- `aria-sort="ascending | descending | none"` attribute kept in sync
- Visual sort-indicator chevron (▲ / ▼) in the header cell
- Keyboard activation (Enter / Space on focused header)
- Screen-reader announcement of new sort order via the existing `announceLive` helper
- Sort state persisted per-table key in `localStorage`

Extends and standardises the existing `ui/sortable.ts` utility — no per-card
reimplementation allowed. Covers both numeric and string columns with locale-aware
`Intl.Collator` comparison.

## 16. Outstanding Work Consolidated

**From prior sprint backlogs (the legacy `Sprint 41–50` todos):**

| Legacy item                                 | Status                              | Mapped to        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Sprint 41: URL state encoder/decoder        | ✅ Built (`share-state.ts`)         | B10 (activation) |
| Sprint 42: CSP header builder               | ✅ Built (`csp-builder.ts`)         | A20 (activation) |
| Sprint 43: SRI/integrity hash helper        | ✅ Built (`sri.ts`)                 | A20 (activation) |
| Sprint 44: Notifications permission wrapper | ✅ Built (`notifications.ts`)       | A14 (activation) |
| Sprint 45: Background sync queue (IDB)      | ✅ Built (`sync-queue.ts`)          | A6 (SW glue)     |
| Sprint 46: Token bucket rate limiter        | ✅ Built (`token-bucket.ts`)        | A8 (Worker side) |
| Sprint 47: ICU-lite message formatter       | ⚠️ Partial                          | C1 / D7          |
| Sprint 48: Synced crosshair state           | ⚠️ Pending                          | B9               |
| Sprint 49: Portfolio sector allocation      | ✅ Built (`portfolio-analytics.ts`) | B2 (activation)  |
| Sprint 50: Equity curve from trades         | ✅ Built (`equity-curve.ts`)        | B4 (activation)  |

**Conclusion:** the legacy todo list is overwhelmingly _built but unwired_. v6.2 (Phase A) is mostly an integration sprint, not a build sprint.

## 18. Decisions Reaffirmed / Reversed / New

### Reaffirmed (kept after rethink #2)

- TypeScript strict, vanilla DOM-first, design tokens, IndexedDB+localStorage tiers,
  Lightweight Charts, Cloudflare Workers, MIT, no-account default, $0/mo target,
  shared MyScripts toolchain, npm, Vite, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier.

### Reversed since April 2026

- **Zod → Valibot** (D14): 90% smaller, identical ergonomics for our use case.
- **Lit "where useful" → Lit only when justified per-card** (D1): risk of toolchain creep.
- **GitHub Pages primary → Cloudflare Pages primary, GH Pages mirror** (D9): preview deploys are non-negotiable.
- **10 sprints/RC → 5 sprints/RC for v6.2** (DX): activation sprints are heavier.

### New since April 2026

- **`src/` → `app/` + npm workspaces** (D50, R3)
- **Stooq as bulk EOD fallback provider** (D7)
- **Per-card `mount()` signature standardization** (R2)
- **Public-API type tests via `tsd`** (D27, R13)
- **`gitleaks` + `socket.dev` supply-chain checks** (D23)
- **Status page via Uptime Kuma** (8.6)
- **View Transitions API for route changes** (D39)
- **Tauri 2.0 desktop wrapper** as v8 stretch (D49)
- **`@property` typed CSS custom properties** (D38)
- **Refactor & Rewrite Backlog** as a first-class section (§17)

### Explicit non-decisions (intentionally not chosen)

- **No Rust/WASM** until profiled need (D31, D46).
- **No React/Vue/Svelte/Solid framework.** Signals + vanilla DOM is sufficient (D1).
- **No Tailwind/UnoCSS.** Tokens + `@layer` win (D4).
- **No Dexie.** `idb.ts` is enough (D36).
- **No Sentry SaaS.** GlitchTip self-hosted (D15).
- **No Google Analytics.** Plausible self-hosted (D16).
- **No Postgres.** KV + R2 + (eventually) D1 (D37).
- **No Electron.** Tauri only if desktop happens (D49).
- **No native iOS/Android** until PWA proven insufficient (D44, E5).
- **No paid data feeds in default config.** Polygon only if user opts in (D7, 14.1).

| Workbox config drift                   | Low        | Medium | Use Workbox build, not runtime injection                                 |
| TS 5.9 → TS 6 migration friction       | Medium     | Low    | Track in Renovate; major bumps in dedicated PR                           |
| Self-hosted GlitchTip outage           | Low        | Low    | Errors degrade to console only; no data loss                             |

| Passkey browser compat (Safari quirks) | Medium     | Medium | Feature-detect; degrade to "no cloud sync"                               |
| OneDrive sync conflicts on dev machine | Medium     | Low    | Repo lives in OneDrive; document `.gitattributes` for CRLF; warn devs    |
| Single-maintainer bus factor           | High       | High   | Document everything (this roadmap); MIT license enables forks            |

## 20. Scope Boundaries

**Building.** Browser-based stock & crypto monitoring dashboard, multi-method
consensus engine, charting, screener, alerts, backtest, portfolio, offline-first
PWA, optional encrypted cloud sync — open source, self-hostable, $0/mo default.

**Not building.**

- Brokerage / order execution / real money flow.
- Social / chat / public profiles.
- Paid SaaS tier.
- Native mobile apps (PWA only).
- AI/LLM features baked into the bundle. (Optional sidecar, never default.)
- Crypto wallets, on-chain anything.
- Newsfeed aggregation (out of scope).
- News sentiment (out of scope).
